Gotham City itself serves as more than mere backdropâ€”it's a character in its own right, reflecting Batman's internal struggles through its gothic architecture and corruption-plagued institutions. The Dark Knight's legendary rogues gallery includes psychological mirrors like the Joker (chaos to Batman's order), Two-Face (duality), Scarecrow (fear), and Catwoman (moral ambiguity). These villains challenge not just Batman's physical abilities but his philosophical foundations, constantly testing his commitment to justice without vengeance.
