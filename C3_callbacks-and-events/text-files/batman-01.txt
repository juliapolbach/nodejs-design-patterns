Batman, born from tragedy in the pages of Detective Comics #27 in 1939, stands as one of pop culture's most enduring icons. After witnessing the murder of his parents as a child, Bruce Wayne dedicates his life to fighting crime in Gotham Cityâ€”not with superpowers, but through intelligence, physical prowess, and technological innovation. The Caped Crusader represents justice tempered by an unbending moral code that prevents him from killing his enemies, creating a complex hero who operates in moral gray areas while maintaining clear ethical boundaries.
